- Connect back at the end of each section to the idea of the "role of the colonial world in the formation of the Anthropocene"
- Go back to "A Hatian Army..." because this may be one of the main points of the paper. Maybe --inevitably-- there are two points that I am making:
	- 1. That _Delirio_ portraits poorly both the Humboldtian and the Bolivarian Nature tropes
	- 2. That digging deeper into the Humboldt-Bolivarian nature tropes, we can grasp an understudied zone of the literary Anthropocene: the one that expands the limits of those humans with agency to act over nature
- Comparar las dos revisiones de *Views*, y tambi√©n el primer volumen de *Relation Historique* (1816)
-  	- Recurrir a "la tierra se allana"
