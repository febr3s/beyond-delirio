If there are some traces left behind in 1822 by Bolivar with respect to Humboldt's nature, these have to do with what the liberation of the slaves in Venezuela in 1816, and later in all of Gran Colombia in 1820, produces in the concept of humanity. The ecstatic and poetic gaze that Bolivar endorses of Chimborazo in 1822, where he recognizes Humboldt's legacy and proposes its overcoming, thematizes a shared passion, and an escalation of Bolivar towards a territory unreached by the German. This territory is that of integrationist and abolitionist yearning turned into action. When, at the end of the poem, Bolivar says "men" he is inhabiting a community of meaning in which the category of human has been extended to all members of the species.

Certainly, in his private literary exercise, Bolívar contributes to form, from this fictitious dialogue with Humboldt's footsteps, the posthumous nationalist myth enthroned in his name that Fernando Coronil describes: "The narrative of Bolívar's triumph depicts the patrician hero as having redirected the rebel masses' anarchic energies toward the construction of a liberal national order" (178). This messianic horizon is the one that Tito Salas condenses in _Apoteosis del Libertador_ and that Mendoza characterizes as "a virulent and delirious prophet, a patriarchal messiah," who has defined the reading of the poem as a revelation of the messianic aura of the Liberator (292, 303). But this cultural fiction -which as we have already exposed is in every sense post- or anti-Bolivarian- says  little about the way in which the Bolivarian project impacted the concept of nature from the learnings of Humboldtian writing or its more immediate consequences.

The greatest impact of the Bolivarian deed in this sense was to redefine in practical terms the limits that since the 17th century excluded huge masses of humans from the "assumption that the role of the state is to provide security of life and property" and "making greater numbers of people live safer" (Dipesh Chakrabarty 205)
<!---  'You can relate this to the idea of Lockean "personhood". It is still a bigger idea of "personhood", because former "beasts" fit here.'--> The extension of property and sovereignty rights to populations that in the outset had been categorized as "beasts" and as "matter" ended up defining, strictly speaking, the planet as a slave of the species as a totality.
