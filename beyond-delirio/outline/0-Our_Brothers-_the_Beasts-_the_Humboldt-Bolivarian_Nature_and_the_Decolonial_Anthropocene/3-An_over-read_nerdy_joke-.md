It is true that in the particular case of nature writing and Humboldt's influence on Bolívar, the _Delirio_ is inevitable as a starting point. The poetic voice measures himself on equal terms with Alexander von Humboldt –according to the actual friendship that they had and that is by Tito Salas in Paris, at the beginning of 19th century –, and claims to leave his "tracks behind". Besides, Bolivar's prose exercise is fundamentally an attempt to make an epic allegory out of the German's geographical imagination of the new world, from the Orinoco to the Andes, passing through the Amazon jungle and the plains. 

the most relevant points of Humboldt and Bolívar's relationship, both in Chimborazo and in his work as a whole: the imaginary integration of the continent's geography, which Manzoni has already pointed out in her  study of Bolívar's writing. The journey from the Caribbean to the other side of the Andes and Chimborazo, passing through the Amazon, epically allegorizes Humboldt's overview of American nature that revolutionized the 19th century literati. But it also traces the territories of the liberating campaign that Bolívar traversed. Therefore, the image of an Haitian army crossing the Andes, foregrounds two aspects of the Humboldtian influence in Bolívar, more relevant and definitory than what the aesthetic reading of Delirio may reveal: the advocacy for abolitionism, and the struggle for the confederation of what we call today Latin America.

The improductivity and pointlesness that Humboldt atributes to climbing the Chimborazo is a necessary framing to ponderate the weight of the _Delirio_ in Bolivar's nature writing. Carlos Abreu Mendoza claims that the improductivity of the _Delirio_ proves that the experience of American nature in Humboldt and Bolivar "invariably concludes in the poetization of the natural sublime through writing." (295). The adjective of invariability extrapolates Humboldt's reasoning about the dubious usefulness of climbing Chimborazo: a failed adventure that he considered more appropriate for an entertainment narrative than for scientific knowledge (Humboldt quoted by Abreu Mendoza). Abreu Mendoza interprets Humboldt's analogy of Chimborazo with Michelangelo's dome as the need for a compensatory aesthetic substitute for the insufficient scientific and practical value of the mountain climb. <!-- add quote and transition --> However <!-- resuena en Abreu Mendoza la usual sobre-amplificación del Delirio en la ingeniería de la figura autoral de Bolívar --> Rather than defining the Bolivarian and Humboldtian relation with nature, the intertext with Humboldt in the specific case of _Delirio_ may lead to a nerdy and playful response to Humboldt's testimony: if it is useless to climb Chimborazo except for an entertaining narration, and it is more worthwhile to contemplate it from the slopes, I write, overwhelmed by its contemplation, a text in which I narrate my adventure without making the useless excursion. 

It is true that _on Chimborazo_ Humboldt's experience of American nature invariably leads to an aestheticization. But to define the whole Humboldt-Bolivarian American experience exclusively from that writing experience only functions to sustain the messianic reception of the _Delirio_ that Abreu Mendoza well characterizes–-a reception that, as we have already exposed, belongs to a posthumous, post and perhaps anti-Bolivarian program of instrumentalization. On the other hand, the affirmation of a nature that when it is not measurable is excluded from the order of rationality and assimilated to the order of the aesthetic sublime, would place Humboldt and Bolivar still too close to "the old Viconian-Hobbesian idea that we, humans, could have proper knowledge of only civil and political institutions because we made them, while nature remains God's work and ultimately inscrutable to man" (Dipesh Chakrabarty 201). <!-- provide an argument here, basically saying that they are not as close as they seem. En plan: de Humboldt, se discute aquí y allá, y la verdad es que no parece. Y en cuanto a Bolívar, es fundamental tener presente que de acuerdo a su política de impresión y su política de archivo, el documento clave es el "Manifiesto"

In the case of the former, there would be some echoes of the inscrutable as the limit of the civil in the notion of the plains as a barrier to history, and of the llaneros whose agency belonged to the plains. In the case of Bolivar, in the _Manifesto_ he resorts to providence to give a name to that which politically orders the sunderedness of human race. In both cases, there are other areas of his work that reestablish a radically different relationship with the immeasurable natural of _Views_ and _Manifesto_. But even if we remain within these texts, the mutual contamination of the commensurable and the incommensurable makes it difficult to sustain that vision, which before the _Delirium_ and after the _Manifesto_ Hegel would categorically organize as peoples belonging to history and peoples belonging to geography.

However, staying there has two disadvantages. The first is the one I have already pointed out: Bolivar's only literary writing is unlikely representative of his oeuvre, on the one hand, and on the other hand it is also probably the least relevant in terms of modern state building--which is what Bolivar is a relevant author for. The second disadvantage is that, as Jiménez points out, _Delirio_ is hardly about nature, since "the explicit omnipresence of the self, the identification of the narrative self with the biographical self, and the use of nature to reflect on a subjectivity before which, in the end, nature disappears and to which it ends up ceding all protagonism" (13). Therefore, to unpack a concept of nature in Bolívar, it is necessary to have a closer look to the territorial dimension of the Bolivarian experience. The _Manifiesto_ approaches us to a moment prior to Bolivar's abolitionist superstardom, where the tension with the "Humboldt tracks" is less evident but more significant for the process of South American emancipation in general, and particularly for the epistemic crisis that was part of this process --and which Bolivar allegorizes with his "head" grazing "the summit of the firmament". Is this what I post that can be found in the _Manifiesto_: the closing statement of the so called "Terrible Year" of 1814, in which Bolívar recognized its project as one "gigantic and superior to all human strength."
