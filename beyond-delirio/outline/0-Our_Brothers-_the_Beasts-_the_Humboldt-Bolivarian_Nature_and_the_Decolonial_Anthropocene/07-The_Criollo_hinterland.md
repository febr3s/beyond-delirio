Walls: Note, though, an important difference he’s pointing to: In Asia, these are pastoral peoples. But the Indigenous peoples of the Americas precisely lacked a pastoral culture, since the fauna of the Americas did not include species suitable for pastoral domestication! (“skipping the stage of a herding life,” p. 35.) 

Febres: interesante regresar a ver esa cita en su contexto. Y aclarar que el sujeto del que está hablando Humboldt aquí --el llanero-- no es indígena ni negro sino criptógamo, y tiene sus rasgos pastorales, pero tiene otros rasgos que no lo son, y que están habitando ya de alguna forma una zona nuclear de la formación de la modernidad --una especie de piratería de tierra, una economía del contrabando y la ilegalidad. Habría que ir a "viaje" a ver qué onda pero pareciera que es así. -->

<!-- "[T]he Llanos are suitable for raising livestock; but the care of milk-giving animals was nearly unknown to the original inhabitants of the New Continent. Hardly any of the American tribes knew to make use of the advantages that Nature had also afforded them in this regard.-->

Walls: This defied contemporary understandings of human development, which was said to require a herding, or pastoral, stage: that is, “stadial” or state-to-state evolution of civilization. . . . which was erected to create a barrier between savage and civil: Indians were savage and couldn't be or have ever been civilized, because they didn't have a pastoral stage, necessary in order to progress to the third stage .

 . . The difference, then, of most relevance here would be that in Asia, human/animal relationships allow the steppes, the barrier, to become a corridor (something that cannot happen without HORSES!); but in Venezuela, no horses (no cattle either): so no transportation, no corridors, no species to graze on the llanos . . . not until Europe brought horses and cattle (invasive species! Not to mention the cowboy culture that came with them . . . .)
 
In short, for point #2, Humboldt's human/nature mixings go all the way down, in ways that still have not been accounted for by most postcolonial scholarship; and so you need to read carefully for all the contextual clues, to catch onto his wider dynamic. The point for you would be to differentiate the kind of agencies involved: in Asia, human/horse partnerships allowed a very different historical unfolding across the Asian steppes than in the Llanos, where no such partnerships were possible, and indeed, historically, the llanos did not invite nor accept Indigenous settlement because of the complex ecological relationships between all the many South American agencies--rain, drought, plant cover, soil, climate, proximity of fertile landscapes, absence of ungulates and horses . . . which would have made settlement possible! Beware of oversimplifying relationships that to Humboldt are always complex, but which he always attempts to trace in their many networked linkages! That is, he's fundamentally an ecological thinker, weaving human and nonhuman ecologies into one locally-varying, constantly-changing and dynamic open whole--his "Cosmos." -->


On the other hand, the notion of "plaything of fortune" puts into operation as a political argument the notion of the uncertainty principle that Humboldt postulates at the end of the first chapter of "Considérations," where a hierarchy of humanity is reaffirmed according to proximity to civilization or nature, but a principle common to all the scales of this hierarchy is recognized, which is "une vie inquiète et orageuse" ("a restless and stormy life"). "Ainsi l'homme se prépare à lui meme une vie inquiète et orageuse, soit que sa grossièreté tienne encore à celle des animaux, doit que l'éclat apparent de la civilisation lui assigne le degré les plus éleve. Le voyageur quis'enfonce sans la nuit des âges, rencontrent sans cesse le tableau uniforme et désolant des dissensions de l'espèce humaine"("Thus man prepares for himself a restless and stormy life, whether his coarseness still holds to that of the animals, or whether the apparent brilliance of civilization assigns him the highest degree. The traveler who sinks into the night of the ages, meets unceasingly the uniform and desolating picture of the dissensions of the human species") <!-- comentar la cita y explicar por qué importa-->(Humboldt 64).
