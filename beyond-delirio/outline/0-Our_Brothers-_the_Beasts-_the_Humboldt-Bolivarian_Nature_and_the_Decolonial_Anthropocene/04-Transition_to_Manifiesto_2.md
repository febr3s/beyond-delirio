In the case of the former, there would be some echoes of the inscrutable as the limit of the civil in the notion of the plains as a barrier to history, and of the llaneros whose agency belonged to the plains. In the case of Bolivar, in the _Manifesto_ he resorts to providence to give a name to that which politically orders the sunderedness of human race. In both cases, there are other areas of his work that reestablish a radically different relationship with the immeasurable natural of _Views_ and _Manifesto_. But even if we remain within these texts, the mutual contamination of the commensurable and the incommensurable makes it difficult to sustain that vision, which before the _Delirium_ and after the _Manifesto_ Hegel would categorically organize as peoples belonging to history and peoples belonging to geography.
