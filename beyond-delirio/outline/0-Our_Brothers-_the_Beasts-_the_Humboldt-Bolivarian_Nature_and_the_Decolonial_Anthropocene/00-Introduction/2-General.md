- Aclarar que lo "humboldtiano" lo defino a partir de Views. Aclarar que Humboldt no negaba la agencia de nadie, sino que empleaba cierto regimen tropico []
	- Walls: In short, for point #2, Humboldt's human/nature mixings go all the 		way down, in ways that still have not been accounted for by most postcolonial 		scholarship; and so you need to read carefully for all the contextual clues, to 		catch onto his wider dynamic. // Beware of oversimplifying relationships that 		to Humboldt are always complex, but which he always attempts to trace in 		their many networked linkages! That is, he's fundamentally an ecological 			thinker, weaving human and nonhuman ecologies into one locally-varying, 		constantly-changing and dynamic open whole--his "Cosmos." --
