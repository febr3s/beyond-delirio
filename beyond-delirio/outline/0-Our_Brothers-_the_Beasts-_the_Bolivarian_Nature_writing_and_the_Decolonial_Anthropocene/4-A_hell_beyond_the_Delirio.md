<Pero no se trata de dejar el Delirio de lado, como ya dije, sino de pensar cómo conversa con un texto destacado por la *arché* propiamente bolivariana, en torno a la pregunta del señorío de la humanidad sobre la naturaleza. En este sentido, es bueno recordar lo que señala Manzoni: >.Como ha señalado Manzoni, el *Delirio* postula una integración poética e imaginaria de distintas regiones que conforman el territorio suramericano [-;;Manzoni pp]. Y en efecto, todo el recorrido que precede al ascenso alucinado al Chimborazo presenta una tensión entre los límites topográficos, y la voluntad del "estandarte" (gran)colombiano para allanarlos. 

Bolívar "venía envuelto en el manto de Iris desde donde paga su tributo el caudaloso Orinoco al Dios de las aguas". Entre la saturación neoclásica se convocan las "bocas" del Dragón y la Serpiente: las amplias desembocaduras donde las aguas del río Orinoco entran en el mar Caribe. Así, la voz traza su trayectoria desde el extremo oriental de la costa Caribe de la gran Colombia, hasta la "región glacial", donde ve las "sienes exelsas del dominador de los Andes": el amplio volcán del Chimborazo, hacia el extremo suroccidental del mapa (gran)colombiano. Es decir, la voz poética integra en su recorrido, bajo el "estandarte" del naciente --y breve-- estado-nación, territorios separados por las densas cordilleras suramericanas. Por eso, entre los argumentos que se da la voz para "trepar sobre los cabellos canosos del gigante de la tierra", se recuerda sus hazañas previas y concluye que "la tierra se ha allanado a los pies de Colombia".

Para llegar a esta conclusión, la voz enumera los obstáculos que ha superado con el "manto de Iris que me ha servido de estandarte". Este "manto" se vuelve el sujeto de la acción, y es él quien "en mis manos", recorre "regiones infernales", surca "los ríos y los mares", y sube "sobre los hombros gigantescos de los andes". En la enumeración, todos los obstáculos son naturales, con excepción del primero. Y en esa irregularidad es donde la naturaleza paisajística y alegórica del *Delirio* empieza conversar con la naturaleza categorial y programática del *Manifiesto*. 



Esto ocurre justo en la oración donde la voz poética ancla el sentido referencial del "manto de Iris" que lo envolvía en la primera línea.

 una obra tan imposible de ejecutar súbitamente, que está fuera del alcance de todo poder humano
 
 estando la masa de los pueblos descarriada por el fanatismo religioso, y seducida por el incentivo de la anarquía devoradora
 
  ¿Cómo podría preponderar la simple teoría de la filosofía política sin otros apoyos que la verdad y la naturaleza, contra el vicio armado con el desenfreno de la licencia, sin más límites que su alcance y convertido de repente por un prestigio religioso en virtud política y en caridad cristiana?
  
  No, no son los hombres vulgares los que pueden calcular el eminente valor del reino de la libertad, para que lo prefieran a la ciega ambición y a la vil codicia
  
   no estando en la esfera de las facultades de un general o magistrado contener en un momento de turbulencia, de choque, y de divergencia de opiniones el torrente de las pasiones humanas, que agitadas por el movimiento de las revoluciones se aumentan en razón de la fuerza que las resiste
   
    El hombre es el débil juguete de la fortuna, sobre la cual suele calcular con fundamento muchas veces, sin poder contar con ella jamás, porque nuestra esfera no está en contacto con la suya de un orden muy superior a la nuestra
    
    La convicción de mi inocencia me la persuade mi corazón, y este testimonio es para mí el más auténtico, bien que parezca un orgulloso delirio
    
    hasta volver segundamente a libertaros, por la senda del occidente, regada con tanta sangre y adornada de tantos laureles.
    
    No comparéis vuestras fuerzas físicas con las enemigas, porque no es comparable el espíritu con la materia. Vosotros sois hombres, ellos son bestias, vosotros sois libres, ellos esclavos.
    
 
 Es laudable, es noble y sublime, vindicar la naturaleza ultrajada por la tiranía; nada es comparable a la grandeza de este acto y aun cuando la desolación y la muerte sean el premio de tan glorioso intento, no hay razón para condenarlo, porque no es lo asequible lo que se debe hacer, sino aquello que el derecho nos autoriza

tan horroroso como imposible pintaros. Vuestros hermanos y no los españoles han desgarrado vuestro seno, derramando vuestra sangre, incendiando vuestros hogares, y os han condenado a la expatriació

un proyecto agigantado, superior a todas las fuerzas humanas

- "Using adjectives such as colossal, majestic, and heavenly, the German explorerinevitably associated the experience of American mountains with thesublime and, therefore, as noted by Mary Louise Pratt, consolidateda view of “a nature that dwarfs humans, commands their being, anddefies their powers of perception” (119–20)"


- inevitable as a starting point
- from the Orinoco to the Andes, passing through the Amazon jungle and the plains. 
- the imaginary integration of the continent's geography, which Manzoni has already pointed out in her  study of Bolívar's writing. The journey from the Caribbean to the other side of the Andes and Chimborazo, passing through the Amazon, epically allegorizes Humboldt's overview of American nature that revolutionized the 19th century literati. But it also traces the territories of the liberating campaign that Bolívar traversed
- advocacy for abolitionism, and the struggle for the confederation of what we call today Latin America. 
- It is true that _on Chimborazo_ Humboldt's experience of American nature invariably leads to an aestheticization that dialogues with Bolívar's _Delirio_. But to define the whole Humboldt-Bolivarian American experience exclusively from that writing experience is sustained in an archive politics that belongs to a posthumous, post and perhaps anti-Bolivarian program of instrumentalization.
- the affirmation of a nature that when it is not measurable is excluded from the order of rationality and assimilated to the order of the aesthetic sublime, would place Humboldt and Bolivar still too close to "the old Viconian-Hobbesian idea that we, humans, could have proper knowledge of only civil and political institutions because we made them, while nature remains God's work and ultimately inscrutable to man" (Dipesh Chakrabarty 201). <!-- provide an argument here, basically saying that they are not as close as they seem. En plan: de Humboldt, se discute aquí y allá, y la verdad es que no parece. Y en cuanto a Bolívar, es fundamental tener presente que de acuerdo a su política de impresión y su política de archivo, el documento clave es el "Manifiesto"

- In the case of the former, there would be some echoes of the inscrutable as the limit of the civil in the notion of the plains as a barrier to history, and of the llaneros whose agency belonged to the plains. In the case of Bolivar, in the _Manifesto_ he resorts to providence to give a name to that which politically orders the sunderedness of human race. In both cases, there are other areas of his work that reestablish a radically different relationship with the immeasurable natural of _Views_ and _Manifesto_. But even if we remain within these texts, the mutual contamination of the commensurable and the incommensurable makes it difficult to sustain that vision, which before the _Delirium_ and after the _Manifesto_ Hegel would categorically organize as peoples belonging to history and peoples belonging to geography.

- modern state building--which is what Bolivar is a relevant author for
- _Delirio_ is hardly about nature, since "the explicit omnipresence of the self, the identification of the narrative self with the biographical self, and the use of nature to reflect on a subjectivity before which, in the end, nature disappears and to which it ends up ceding all protagonism" (13). 
- To unpack a concept of nature in Bolívar, it is necessary to have a closer look to the territorial dimension of the Bolivarian experience. The _Manifiesto_ approaches us to a moment prior to Bolivar's abolitionist superstardom, where the tension with the "Humboldt tracks" is less evident but more significant for the process of South American emancipation in general, and particularly for the epistemic crisis that was part of this process --and which Bolivar allegorizes with his "head" grazing "the summit of the firmament". Is this what I post that can be found in the _Manifiesto_: the closing statement of the so called "Terrible Year" of 1814, in which Bolívar recognized its project as one "gigantic and superior to all human strength."


do a transition to manifesto out of this 

Aquí la naturaleza no es un marco referencial paisajístico, sobresaturado de referencias mitológicas por un escritor amateur.
To explain, in 1814, the defeat of his army at the hands of the llaneros, Bolivar resorts to an animalization of non-white populations -part of the slave production system of colonialism[3](#ftn9)-- by calling them "beasts." 

-->}
And to propose another point of Humboldtian influence in Bolivar's notion of nature, I note the echoes in this text of the first chapter of _Tableaux de la nature_, "Considérations sur les steppes et déserts" (1808), where the German characterizes the llanero populations of Asia as natural phenomena. Both Humboldt and Bolívar affirm limits of the human anchored to a pattern of civilization, in which certain forms of political or social organization that do not respond to these parameters are assimilated to the realm of the natural or non-human --as darkness, as animal, as geographical accident or self-generated agency of a certain landscape[4](#ftn10). But this dualistic vision becomes discontinuous and permeable in Bolivar's discourse when he calls the "beasts" "brothers." Similarly, Humboldt introduces in his text notions that put in suspense the ontological security that is sustained in the rigid division between human and nature. This notion of mutual contamination between what is conceived as human and what is conceived as non-human, will be put into work in Bolivar's political project, in an implicity broadening of the concept of humanity, which takes shape, again in Carúpano, with decree for the abolition of slavery in 1816.

In order to understand the density of the text I am going to analyze, it is necessary to give some clues about its writing context, and about the reality it tries to name. Tito Salas, in _Emigración a Oriente_, shows in a nutshell the so-called "Terrible Year" of 1814. The white Creole elite of Caracas, flees to the Eastern part of the country. Children, women, the elderly and white men, some of them barefoot, trudge over rough terrain, led by someone carrying the Venezuelan flag. Some of them are looking back, connoting the horror that haunts them. They are fleeing from a popular rebellion that rose up against the republican project, led by a caudillo of Spanish origin, but starring the vastly majority non-white population of the country <!-- agregar nota apoyado en Castro-Gómez y otros para indicar a qué me refiero con esta categoría -->. José Tomás Boves had organized in the Venezuelan plains an irregular army with the most oppressed and excluded population of Venezuelan society. A population that the pro-independence Creole elite wanted to use rhetorically in a discourse of equality, without granting social rights. And even more: by rolling back concessions that the Spanish empire had begun to make during the Bourbon reforms. A significant part of this rebel army had been enslaved on the plantation and had been freed by the royalist army to be enlisted. But the army of rebels that converged on the Venezuelan plains was less uniform than that of Haiti, where the overwhelming majority came directly from the slave trade. The excluded palette of Boves' llaneros ranged from people coming from the slave trade to absolute outsiders, who were in no way part of Venezuelan legality[7](#ftn13). This may give us an idea of what Bolivar means by "infernal regions" in the _Delirio_.

I will quote the Dominican Republic author Juan Bosch, who summarizes the problem in his book _Bolivar y la guerra social_: "Bolivar thought and acted in terms of society, and that is why his struggle was aimed at the creation of a State, and Boves felt and acted in terms of the mass, and that mass was at war against the society of which he had been a part". That is why the _Manifiesto_ expresses much more than a military defeat: it expresses the inability to conquer the desire of the masses. It expresses the fact that the republicans were not defeated by the Spanish empire, but by the very people they intended to liberate. It is the dramatic aporia expressed when he says: "Thus, it would seem that heaven, to bring us humiliation and then glory, allowed our conquerors to be our brothers and our brothers, no one else, to triumph over us". This aporia is much more dense and interesting when we think of the regime of dichotomous tropes in which it is inserted. Bolivar defeated by his own people divides the social and national world into men/beasts and free/slaves, and at the same time establishes a filial, fraternal relationship between those opposites. If the journey of the _Delirio_ is from east to west, from the Orinoco Delta to the Andes, the exodus of 1814 goes in the opposite direction. <!-- Unpack what is comming. Explain what is  this and give a foreshsadow of how it contributes to argue with Chakrabarty --> And if in the Delirio an integrating look of the territory is postulated in the poetic imagination, in the _Manifesto_ it is a matter of assimilating a rupture through the political imagination.

The movement that dominates the _Manifesto_ is toward a reaffirmation of "the age-old humanist distinction between natural history and human history," that the anthropogenic explanations of climate change spell in the contemporary conversation (Dipesh Chakrabarty 201). The punch line of the manifesto radicalizes this division into a series of equivalent dualities. Stating that "one cannot compare spirit with matter," Bolívar defines a division of nationality into incommensurable groups of you-men-free-spirit (whites) and them-beasts-slaves-matter (non-whites). However, in the previous development, attributes have been given to these entities, which pollute the boundaries of this division. The beast-slaves are, in addition to brothers, "compatriots," "mass of the peoples," "frenzied multitude," and "vulgar men," whose spirit has been perverted or deluded and who suffer from "insanity." These last two attributes are especially relevant because they are conditions to which these free-men, supposedly incommensurable with the beast-slaves, are also exposed. Dementia is a threat that hangs over the "you" when Bolivar asks them to "not alienate you"–and retrospectively, it is privately acknowledged as an attribute, albeit a passing one, of the same author eight years later in the _Delirio_. And the "perverted spirit" implies a contamination in two senses: the "matter" embodied by the slave beasts has also a spirit, though perverted; and the spirit of free men may be perverted, as the threat of alienation suggests.

The attribute most often repeated for the "they" is that of the slave. And although this attribute also appears in the _Manifiesto_ as potentially assignable to free men – "against those blind (…) chains," this condition, in the context that Bolivar writes, is very hardly commensurable. At this point, Bolívar still employs the trope of slavery in the sense of John Locke, who uses it both as a synonym for tyranny and as the almost always ineffable antithesis of the free human, to whom God has granted sovereignty over nature in _Two Treatises of Government_. This rhetorical use of the "slave" signifier in Bolivar's context becomes especially problematic in light of "the social death imparted on Indigenous Americans and enslaved Africans [which] are certainly two originary catastrophes forming the basis of global modernity and systematically repressed in discourse" (Saldanha 22) As Buck-Morss demonstrates, European liberalism was able to speculate limitlessly with the trope of the slave, without clashing with the concrete referent of the system of production that sustained it economically. But in Bolivar the trope of chains and the slave acquired a weight totally unprecedented among the "philosophers of freedom" who promoted the division between human history and natural history (Chakrabarty 208). And this had consequences: the _Manifiesto_, in which he most rudely boasted of the free status of some compatriots and denigrated the slavery of others based based on such division, was also his last proclamation in Venezuela before the decree of emancipation of the slaves, in 1816, after a two-year Caribbean exile.  The _Manifiesto_ is just the beginning of the transition towards an abolitionist period of the Emancipation movement. But already these points of mutual contamination between white spirit-men-freemen and non-white spirit-beasts-slaves-matter foreshadow a dissolution of the boundary that reserved, in the European "philosophers of freedom" human sovereignty over nature to a portion of the species, while enabling the exploitation as bestial matter of the rest of it.
