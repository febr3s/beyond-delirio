Because it mentions landscapes and Alexander Von Humboldt, the poem *Mi delirio sobre el Chimborazo* has traditionally been the starting place for characterizing Bolívar's concept of nature <!--note: examples including LEAR-->. The 594-word text was part of Bolívar's private papers and was first made public in 1833. It was the last item of the XXVII volume of the _Coleccion de documentos relativos a la vida pública del libertador de Columbia y del Peru, Simon Bolivar_, published in Caracas by the Danniron and Dupouny Press: the first volume of the collection printed without Bolivar's authorization [note: Bolivar had ordered his lieutenant Laurence Florencio O'Leary to destroy his private papers]. It is only piece of "creative writing" in the Liberator's archive, and it condenses the tension that runs through the Bolivarian archive. As Carrera Damas demonstrates, the politics of Bolivarian memory not only differed from the discourse and project of the historical Simón Bolívar, but openly contradicts them [;;CarreraDamas pp]. If, as Derrida proposes, "there is no political power without control of the archive", the power that controls Bolivar's archive is not that of Bolivar --who in life was one of the most powerful men of the continent-- but that of the detractors who succeeded him. In a more specific sense, I argue that nature writing in Bolivar has been silenced in some areas and amplified in others in order to homogeneously relate it to a Latin American and Latin Americanist tradition of nature writing. 

For this tradition, the natural world is "a terrain of power used to justify and metaphorically expand the claims of political legitimacy of local and regional elites". The definition belongs to the *Latin American Eco-cultural Reader*, which in 2020 published a new translation of Bolivar's poem, along with canonical texts and fragments of nature writing in Latin America. From *Delirio*, the anthologists propose that Bolívar belongs to a group of writers who made the representation of nature "the rhetorical ground on which to base their claims" (French and Heffes 74, 75). Bolívar, together with Andrés Bello and Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, would be inscribed in this tradition. But this homologation hides more than it shows about Bolivar's contribution to the consolidation of the Anthropocene. On the one hand, it is not difficult to relate Bolivar's writing to the patrician tradition that imagined, designed and applied as far as possible a program of domestication of nature by means of the word [note: ;;Rama, ;;Ramos, ;;Martínez-Pinzón].
However, it is deceptive to assume that the "rethorical ground" that defines the parameters of this program is established in *Delirio*. First, because it is a text conceived without access to the public, prevented from "justifying and amplifying" a certain ideological notion of nature. Second, because the *Delirio* is in more than one sense the opposite of a "rethorical ground". Its enunciation points to a "[d]espropósito" and "disparate" ("delirio"), where the poetic voice states that "el éter sofoca mi aliento", before relating how it is possessed and interpellated by alien and supernatural entities [;;BolivarDelirio pp].The proliferation of mythological entities that rub up against this voice, its altered state of consciousness, and the --imaginary-- elevation above the most distant point from the center of the earth on the planet indicate in more than one sense a separation from the *ground*.

I do not imply that the realm of fantasy and hallucination cannot be part of the "rethorical ground" on which a politics of nature is built. What I propose is to put in dialogue the private literary exercise with other zones of the archive, less referential to the landscape, but grounded in the limits of the historical, and oriented to public judgment and amplification. Particularly, I am interested in approaching the *Manifesto de Carúpano* of 1814, a text whose inclusion in the *Colección de documentos* --as Vicente Lecuna reminds us-- was explicitly requested by Bolívar to the person in charge of making the anthology [-;;Lecuna pp].
