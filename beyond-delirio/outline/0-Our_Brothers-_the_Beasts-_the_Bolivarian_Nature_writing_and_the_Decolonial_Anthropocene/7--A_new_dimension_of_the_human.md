To point out the way in which Bolivar inhabited with reason what in 1814 he attributed to God and nature, a historical inaccuracy in the review of Bolivar presented in the _LAER_ helps us: "After nearly a decade of conflict, he crossed th Andes with a Haitian army and took control of Colombia in 1819" (French and Heffes 76). The apocryphal data produces in a metonymy what Zizek calls a super-rapid historicization: In 1816, after returning to Venezuela with an army of Haitians to decree the abolition of slavery, Bolívar began a series of operations, speeches, pacts, executions and exploits, which led him to cross the platforms with some of the same men he had called beasts in 1814 – and who, like the Haitians, had been slaves, if not outlaws, before becoming republican soldiers. 


focusing on the so-called "first wave of decolonization" (Thurner et al.). I argue that the arc between the _Manifesto_ and Bolivar's _Decree of Abolition of the Slaves_, leads to an expanded postulation 

I propose that, read in the light of the _Manifiesto_ and its relation with Humboldt beyond an aesthetic framework, the messianic and promethean high-flownness of Bolivar's private poetic text of 1822 expresses a radicalized dimension of the global, that manifests itself in the first wave of decolonization, and that unlike the European global that serves as a paradigm for Chakrabarty is not restricted to a limited number of members of the species.

If there are some traces left behind in 1822 by Bolivar with respect to Humboldt's nature, these have to do with what the liberation of the slaves in Venezuela in 1816, and later in all of Gran Colombia in 1820, produces in the concept of humanity. The ecstatic and poetic gaze that Bolivar endorses of Chimborazo in 1822, where he recognizes Humboldt's legacy and proposes its overcoming, thematizes a shared passion, and an escalation of Bolivar towards a territory unreached by the German. This territory is that of integrationist and abolitionist yearning turned into action. When, at the end of the poem, Bolivar says "men" he is inhabiting a community of meaning in which the category of human has been extended to all members of the species.

Certainly, in his private literary exercise, Bolívar contributes to form, from this fictitious dialogue with Humboldt's footsteps, the posthumous nationalist myth enthroned in his name that Fernando Coronil describes: "The narrative of Bolívar's triumph depicts the patrician hero as having redirected the rebel masses' anarchic energies toward the construction of a liberal national order" (178). This messianic horizon is the one that Tito Salas condenses in _Apoteosis del Libertador_ and that Mendoza characterizes as "a virulent and delirious prophet, a patriarchal messiah," who has defined the reading of the poem as a revelation of the messianic aura of the Liberator (292, 303). But this cultural fiction -which as we have already exposed is in every sense post- or anti-Bolivarian- says  little about the way in which the Bolivarian project impacted the concept of nature from the learnings of Humboldtian writing or its more immediate consequences.

The greatest impact of the Bolivarian deed in this sense was to redefine in practical terms the limits that since the 17th century excluded huge masses of humans from the "assumption that the role of the state is to provide security of life and property" and "making greater numbers of people live safer" (Dipesh Chakrabarty 205)

NOTE: 'You can relate this to the idea of Lockean "personhood". It is still a bigger idea of "personhood", because former "beasts" fit here.']

NOTE: 'So this is where the "expansion" of Anthropocene fits in?']
The extension of property and sovereignty rights to populations that in the outset had been categorized as "beasts" and as "matter" ended up defining, strictly speaking, the planet as a slave of the species as a totality.
