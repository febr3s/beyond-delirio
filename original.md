Humboldtian limits of humanity in Bolivar's _Manifiesto de Carúpano_

The reading of the Humboldtian concept of nature in Bolivar has been made from _Mi delirio sobre el Chimborazo_, a text that had no public relevance until its posthumous publication, in 1833, and whose authenticity has been discussed. The recent anthology _The Latin American Cultural Reader_ begins the section dedicated to the founding of Latin American nation-states with a new translation of this prose poem. Probably written in 1822, on a festive occasion[1](#ftn1), it was part of the Libertador's private archive, an archive whose destruction Bolivar requested his aide-de-camp, the Irishman Laurence Florence O'Leary, and which O'Leary disobeyed. It is therefore problematic to define, from the _Delirio_, a concept of the natural world in Bolívar as "a terrain of power, used to metaphorically justify and amplify the claims to political legitimacy of local and regional elites on the eve of, during, and after the struggle for national independence" (French and Heffes 74). The text had no function in Bolivar's public life, and most probably belongs to what, as an author, he had the will to exclude from his work. Its reading would serve, in any case, to probe a certain understanding of nature in Bolívar's subjectivity, not to prove its instrumentalization to amplify the political legitimacy of the elites.

If there is a group of writers who made the representation of nature in the _Delirio_ "the rhetorical ground on which to stake their claims" (French and Heffes 75) –among whom the anthologists count Andrés Bello and Domingo Faustino Sarmiento–, Bolívar cannot be counted among them from the writing of this poem, for its circulation was not part of his project. Even more: if there was a project that promoted the circulation of this poem to instrumentalize it politically, it was precisely the one that emerged after his death, and against him. Or at least against his great project, which was the Gran Colombia and the Latin American supranationality. It was during the Venezuelan oligarchic government, which contributed to the dissolution of the great Andean-Caribbean republic[2](#ftn8), that this literary exercise, belonging to the intimacy of the Libertador, was published for the first time. It is the last text of the XXVII volume of the _Coleccion de documentos relativos a la vida pública del libertador de Columbia y del Peru, Simon Bolivar_, published in Caracas in 1933 by the Danniron and Dupouny Press.

There are other reasons why it is problematic to focus the analysis of the Humboldt-Bolivarian concept of nature on the 1822 controversially attributed manuscript. These I will evaluate later. For now I limit myself to propose that for this characterization of the Bolivarian nature, it would be necessary at least to contrast the _Delirio_ with documents that he had the will to make public during his lifetime.

This is what I propose to do in this article, where I will analyze the _Manifesto de Carúpano_ of 1814, the text that Bolívar proclaims to appear before the remnants of the republic after what was his most apotheosis defeat in his political life. As Fernando Coronil succinctly summarizes: "[Bolívar] brought over the revolutionary cause the unruly llaneros, mestizo plainsmen who initially supported the Spanish crown during the Independence War (1811-21). At the outset, the llaneros and rebel slaves made devastating attacks on the families and estates of the landed oligarchy, turning the conflict into a civil war with racial dimensions" (178). The _Manifesto_ is located in this_outset_ indicated by Coronil. Or more precisely, at the beginning of the transition that allowed Bolivar to include the llaneros in the republican project. It is the last text he makes public in Venezuela before leaving for Caribbean exile, from where he returns two years later with Haitian soldiers and the first decree abolishing slavery on the mainland.

To explain, in 1814, the defeat of his army at the hands of the llaneros, Bolivar resorts to an animalization of non-white populations -part of the slave production system of colonialism[3](#ftn9)-- by calling them "beasts." And to propose another point of Humboldtian influence in Bolivar's notion of nature, I note the echoes in this text of the first chapter of _Tableaux de la nature_, "Considérations sur les steppes et déserts" (1808), where the German characterizes the llanero populations of Asia as natural phenomena. Both Humboldt and Bolívar affirm limits of the human anchored to a pattern of civilization, in which certain forms of political or social organization that do not respond to these parameters are assimilated to the realm of the natural or non-human --as darkness, as animal, as geographical accident or self-generated agency of a certain landscape[4](#ftn10). But this dualistic vision becomes discontinuous and permeable in Bolivar's discourse when he calls the "beasts" "brothers." Similarly, Humboldt introduces in his text notions that put in suspense the ontological security that is sustained in the rigid division between human and nature. This notion of mutual contamination between what is conceived as human and what is conceived as non-human, will be put into work in Bolivar's political project, in an implicity broadening of the concept of humanity, which takes shape, again in Carúpano, with decree for the abolition of slavery in 1816.

role of the colonial world in the formation of the Anthropocene, focusing on the so-called "first wave of decolonization" (Thurner et al.). I argue that the arc between the _Manifesto_ and Bolivar's _Decree of Abolition of the Slaves_, leads to an expanded postulation of the global, as conceived by Dipesh Chakrabarty: an instance of the world where the sovereignty of the totality of the human over nature –understood in Lockean terms– assumes the unlimited exploitation of nature[5](#ftn11). En _The Climate of History in a Planetary Age_, the historian proposes a point of "indifference to the biosphere built into political thought" as a product of the "Lockean notion of personhood" built since XVII Century, in which the individual was made "the focus, the bearer of life and rights and the recipient of welfare," despite of their numbers (212). I propose that, read in the light of the _Manifiesto_ and its relation with Humboldt beyond an aesthetic framework, the messianic and promethean high-flownness of Bolivar's private poetic text of 1822 expresses a radicalized dimension of the global, that manifests itself in the first wave of decolonization, and that unlike the European global that serves as a paradigm for Chakrabarty is not restricted to a limited number of members of the species.

famous he was him in the 1820's in the U.S. we can think of Orlando Bolívar Willcox and Simón Bolívar Buckner. They fought together in the Mexican-American War, and against each other in the U.S. American Civil War. Born in 1823, they were among many children in the US being named after El Libertador by those years. In 1822, when he wrote the Delirio sobre el Chimborazo, he was already the liberator of a territory that today is equivalent to four countries --Ecuador, Venezuela, Colombia and Panama-- and was preparing to lead the emancipation of two more --Peru and Alto Peru, which was named after him, Bolivia. He was also the leader of the most far-reaching abolitionist movement in the world, following in Haiti's footsteps in the Mainland. On that superstar scale, deified, is where Bolivar's poem is written --and also where it is read. This deification can be read in the _Delirio_, in the the radically zenithal gaze of the "watchtower of the Universe", in the Promethean excess of "nothing will stop me" and "not even time could hold back freedom". It is a poetic voice --which we will call Bolivar-- that rubs shoulders with the gods and accepts no lessons from them.

Tracking how such deification is built on this narrative poem might help to put in perspective both the relation with Humboldt and how limited it is to establish from it a perspective on Bolivarian writing. Bolivar comes wrapped in an accessory of the emissary of the gods, Iris –which might be also interpreted as an epithet of the Colombian flag. He comes from the Columbus Channel, "where the Orinoco pays its tribute to the god of the waters." He sets out to climb what was believed to be the highest peak in the 19th century and which recent measurements have confirmed, given its distance from the center of the Earth. After comparing himself to a third deity[6](#ftn12), claiming that he left behind Humboldt's and La Condamaine'd tracks, and being possessed by the God of Colombia, he meets Chronos –"God of Time"– who tries to give him a lesson on the smallness of his exploits in the face of the size of infinity. Bolivar contradicts him, still possessed by the God of Colombia. He argues that his exploits and a series of visions enable him to evanesce himself. His objection seems to change the opinion of Chronos, who no longer insists on pointing out Bolivar's hybris, but recommends him to share with men these visions, which he qualifies as "truth". Then he disappears, revealing that in reality he was not a god but a phantom ("fantasma") –an ambiguity or flaw that the translator dissolves by transcribing it as "apparition." Colombia cries out, without it being clear whether "Colombia"" is an apocope for "God of Colombia," or whether Colombia is another character --which, although complicated, would be more coherent, since according to the plot at this moment Bolivar and the God of Colombia are the same person. Finally, we learn that Bolivar had been dead all that time, and that he recovers his condition of man, to get up and write the text we read.

As Jiménez has pointed out, the allegorical quality of this exercise is highly ambiguous: "[t]he secrets referred to in Time are not obvious, as they could allude to the experience of disillusionment (to the realization of the vanity of the human in the face of the greatness of Chimborazo and Time) or to what has been learned from the eminence of the mountain, which provides a real and metaphorical point of view that extends beyond the usual" (12). On the other hand, with his saturation of classical mythological references, Bolivar incurs here in the fault that he claims to José Joaquín Olmedo, when he writes a critique of his _Canto a Junín_: "[yo]u make us in your poetic and fantastic way; and to continue in the country of poetry the fiction of the fable, you elevate us with your lying deity, as the eagle of Jupiter lifted the tortoise to the skies to let it fall on a rock that would break its creeping limbs: you, then, have sublimated us so much that you have precipitated us into the abyss of nothingness." The way in which this text contradicts Bolívar's own criteria regarding what is fatuous in the writing of the American epic, and its elusive allegorical sense are sufficient reasons to question its protagonic consideration to characterize a concept of nature in Bolívar. It is hard to think that a poem like this would have been so commented and edited if it were not part of Bolivar's superstardom. El Libertador has a written work of great depth, originality and strength, but his genres were personal correspondence, proclamation and political essay. This literary exercise is more exceptional than representative of him as Muñoz states, it is probably "the most bizarre text Bolívar ever composed" (171).

It is true that in the particular case of nature writing and Humboldt's influence on Bolívar, the _Delirio_ is inevitable as a starting point. The poetic voice measures himself on equal terms with Alexander von Humboldt –according to the actual friendship that they had and that is by Tito Salas in Paris, at the beginning of 19th century –, and claims to leave his "tracks behind". Besides, Bolivar's prose exercise is fundamentally an attempt to make an epic allegory out of the German's geographical imagination of the new world, from the Orinoco to the Andes, passing through the Amazon jungle and the plains. However, staying there has two disadvantages. The first is the one I have already pointed out: Bolivar's only literary writing is unlikely representative of his oeuvre, on the one hand, and on the other hand it is also probably the least relevant in terms of modern state building--which is what Bolivar is a relevant author for. The second disadvantage is that, as Jiménez points out, _Delirio_ is hardly about nature, since "the explicit omnipresence of the self, the identification of the narrative self with the biographical self, and the use of nature to reflect on a subjectivity before which, in the end, nature disappears and to which it ends up ceding all protagonism" (13). Therefore, to unpack a concept of nature in Bolívar, it is necessary to have a closer look to the territorial dimension of the Bolivarian experience. The _Manifiesto_ approaches us to a moment prior to Bolivar's abolitionist superstardom, where the tension with the "Humboldt tracks" is less evident but more significant for the process of South American emancipation in general, and particularly for the epistemic crisis that was part of this process --and which Bolivar allegorizes with his "head" grazing "the summit of the firmament". Is this what I post that can be found in the _Manifiesto_: the closing statement of the so called "Terrible Year" of 1814, in which Bolívar recognized its project as one "gigantic and superior to all human strength."

## ​Our brothers, the beasts

In order to understand the density of the text I am going to analyze, it is necessary to give some clues about its writing context, and about the reality it tries to name. Tito Salas, in _Emigración a Oriente_, shows in a nutshell the so-called "Terrible Year" of 1814. The white Creole elite of Caracas, flees to the Eastern part of the country. Children, women, the elderly and white men, some of them barefoot, trudge over rough terrain, led by someone carrying the Venezuelan flag. Some of them are looking back, connoting the horror that haunts them. They are fleeing from a popular rebellion that rose up against the republican project, led by a caudillo of Spanish origin, but starring the vastly majority non-white population of the country. José Tomás Boves, had organized in the Venezuelan plains an irregular army with the most oppressed and excluded population of Venezuelan society. A population that the pro-independence Creole elite wanted to use rhetorically in a discourse of equality, without granting social rights. And even more: by rolling back concessions that the Spanish empire had begun to make during the Bourbon reforms. A significant part of this rebel army had been enslaved on the plantation and had been freed by the royalist army to be enlisted. But the army of rebels that converged on the Venezuelan plains was less uniform than that of Haiti, where the overwhelming majority came directly from the slave trade. The excluded palette of Boves' llaneros ranged from people coming from the slave trade to absolute outsiders, who were in no way part of Venezuelan legality[7](#ftn13). This may give us an idea of what Bolivar means by "infernal regions" in the _Delirio_.

I will quote the Dominican Republic author Juan Bosch, who summarizes the problem in his book _Bolivar y la guerra social_: "Bolivar thought and acted in terms of society, and that is why his struggle was aimed at the creation of a State, and Boves felt and acted in terms of the mass, and that mass was at war against the society of which he had been a part". That is why the _Manifiesto_ expresses much more than a military defeat: it expresses the inability to conquer the desire of the masses. It expresses the fact that the republicans were not defeated by the Spanish empire, but by the very people they intended to liberate. It is the dramatic aporia expressed when he says: "Thus, it would seem that heaven, to bring us humiliation and then glory, allowed our conquerors to be our brothers and our brothers, no one else, to triumph over us". This aporia is much more dense and interesting when we think of the regime of dichotomous tropes in which it is inserted. Bolivar defeated by his own people divides the social and national world into men/beasts and free/slaves, and at the same time establishes a filial, fraternal relationship between those opposites. If the journey of the _Delirio_ is from east to west, from the Orinoco Delta to the Andes, the exodus of 1814 goes in the opposite direction.

And if in the Delirio an integrating look of the territory is postulated in the poetic imagination, in the _Manifesto_ it is a matter of assimilating a rupture through the political imagination.

The movement that dominates the _Manifesto_ is toward a reaffirmation of "the age-old humanist distinction between natural history and human history," that the anthropogenic explanations of climate change spell in the contemporary conversation (Dipesh Chakrabarty 201). The punch line of the manifesto radicalizes this division into a series of equivalent dualities. Stating that "one cannot compare spirit with matter," Bolívar defines a division of nationality into incommensurable groups of you-men-free-spirit (whites) and them-beasts-slaves-matter (non-whites). However, in the previous development, attributes have been given to these entities, which pollute the boundaries of this division. The beast-slaves are, in addition to brothers, "compatriots," "mass of the peoples," "frenzied multitude," and "vulgar men," whose spirit has been perverted or deluded and who suffer from "insanity." These last two attributes are especially relevant because they are conditions to which these free-men, supposedly incommensurable with the beast-slaves, are also exposed. Dementia is a threat that hangs over the "you" when Bolivar asks them to "not alienate you"–and retrospectively, it is privately acknowledged as an attribute, albeit a passing one, of the same author eight years later in the _Delirio_. And the "perverted spirit" implies a contamination in two senses: the "matter" embodied by the slave beasts has also a spirit, though perverted; and the spirit of free men may be perverted, as the threat of alienation suggests.

The attribute most often repeated for the "they" is that of the slave. And although this attribute also appears in the _Manifiesto_ as potentially assignable to free men – "against those blind (…) chains," this condition, in the context that Bolivar writes, is very hardly commensurable. At this point, Bolívar still employs the trope of slavery in the sense of John Locke, who uses it both as a synonym for tyranny and as the almost always ineffable antithesis of the free human, to whom God has granted sovereignty over nature in _Two Treatises of Government_. This rhetorical use of the "slave" signifier in Bolivar's context becomes especially problematic in light of "the social death imparted on Indigenous Americans and enslaved Africans [which] are certainly two originary catastrophes forming the basis of global modernity and systematically repressed in discourse" (Saldanha 22) As Buck-Morss demonstrates, European liberalism was able to speculate limitlessly with the trope of the slave, without clashing with the concrete referent of the system of production that sustained it economically. But in Bolivar the trope of chains and the slave acquired a weight totally unprecedented among the "philosophers of freedom" who promoted the division between human history and natural history (Chakrabarty 208). And this had consequences: the _Manifiesto_, in which he most rudely boasted of the free status of some compatriots and denigrated the slavery of others based based on such division, was also his last proclamation in Venezuela before the decree of emancipation of the slaves, in 1816, after a two-year Caribbean exile.  The _Manifiesto_ is just the beginning of the transition towards an abolitionist period of the Emancipation movement. But already these points of mutual contamination between white spirit-men-freemen and non-white spirit-beasts-slaves-matter foreshadow a dissolution of the boundary that reserved, in the European "philosophers of freedom" human sovereignty over nature to a portion of the species, while enabling the exploitation as bestial matter of the rest of it.

## ​Geography against history

The boundaries drawn by Humboldt in "Considérations" between the forms of civilization recognized by the European tradition and the political agency of other populations are much more subtle than the dichotomies of Bolivar in 1814. Nevertheless, his typification of the llanos in the first chapter of this essay–focused on Venezuela but fueled by equivalences and solutions of continuity with other "steppes and deserts of the world"–is strongly echoed in Bolívar's manifesto.

Humboldt makes an observation that prefigures the symbolic role that the vast plains region of Venezuela played in 1814, where the "devouring anarchy" of Boves' army that frustrated Bolivar's republic project was formed: "[t]he plains of southern America also serve as a limit to the semi-civilization imported from Europe" (Humboldt 34-35). Humboldt defines this region as "frightful solitude (…) [with S]elvas of impenetrable depth" that lies to the south of "industrious cities, laughing villages and carefully cultivated fields" (35). That is to say, the llanero limit to semi-civilization that Humboldt defines is a purely geographical entity, without human agency. In this vein, according to Humboldt's observations of the Asian plains, the ambiguously human agency of the llaneros could be attributed to the geographical entity. After stating that the steppes of Mongolia and Tartary have been a geographical barrier between the "people who are still rude" ("des peuples encore grossiers") and the "the race of anciently civilized men" ("la race d'hommes anciennement civilisés") of Hindustan and Tibet, he asserts: "But it is not only in this respect that history must consider the plains of the interior of Asia. They have more than once spread misfortune and devastation over the whole earth. The pastoral peoples who inhabit them, such as the Avars, the Mongols, the Alans and the Uzes, have shaken the world" ("Mais ce n'est pas seulement sous ces rapports que l'histoire doit considérer les plaines de l'intérieur de l'Asie. Elles ont plus d'une fois d'une fois répandu sur toute la terre le malheur et la dévastation. Les peuples pasteurs qui les habitent, tels que les Avares, les Mongols, les Alains et les Uzes, ont ébranlé le monde.") (Humboldt 15)

In Humboldt's observation, the agency of certain peoples belongs to geography. The Asiatic plainsmen moved the world to bring calamity and devastation. But the action wasn't performed by the plainsmen, but by the plains, whose barbarism "have more than once spread misfortune and devastation over the whole earth" ("ont plus d'une fois d'une fois répendu sur toute la terre le malheur et la dévastation") (16). That is, if Humboldt elaborated from the experience of the Andean mountains a view of nature that dwarfs and dominates humans (Mary Louise Pratt quoted by Mendoza), in this view of the Asiatic plains, the llaneros command their inhabitants to unleash catastrophes upon civilization.  On the other hand, in _Manifiesto_, Bolívar does not expand the "hegemonic lens of the sublime" into a rhetoric of the immense and overwhealming landscape–as he does in _Delirio_ (Mendoza 294). However, he employs the sublime principle implicit in Humboldt's reasoning, where to give entity to the non-comprehensible or non-measurable human, he resorts to the order of the geographical or the natural.

Bolivar defines as "turbulence" and "torrent" that of the political agency that escaped his will to contain. On the other hand, the notion of "plaything of fortune" puts into operation as a political argument the notion of the uncertainty principle that Humboldt postulates at the end of the first chapter of "Considérations," where a hierarchy of humanity is reaffirmed according to proximity to civilization or nature, but a principle common to all the scales of this hierarchy is recognized, which is "une vie inquiète et orageuse" ("a restless and stormy life"). "Ainsi l'homme se prépare à lui meme une vie inquiète et orageuse, soit que sa grossièreté tienne encore à celle des animaux, doit que l'éclat apparent de la civilisation lui assigne le degré les plus éleve. Le voyageur quis'enfonce sans la nuit des âges, rencontrent sans cesse le tableau uniforme et désolant des dissensions de l'espèce humaine"

("Thus man prepares for himself a restless and stormy life, whether his coarseness still holds to that of the animals, or whether the apparent brilliance of civilization assigns him the highest degree. The traveler who sinks into the night of the ages, meets unceasingly the uniform and desolating picture of the dissensions of the human species") (Humboldt 64).

## ​A Haitian Army crosses the Andes

The improductivity and pointlesness that Humboldt atributes to climbing the Chimborazo is a necessary framing to ponderate the weight of the _Delirio_ in Bolivar's nature writing. Carlos Abreu Mendoza claims that this improductivity of the _Delirio_ proves that the experience of American nature in Humboldt and Bolivar "invariably concludes in the poetization of the natural sublime through writing." (295). The adjective of invariability extrapolates Humboldt's reasoning about the dubious usefulness of climbing Chimborazo, a failed adventure that he considered more appropriate for an entertainment narrative than for scientific knowledge (Humboldt quoted by Abreu Mendoza). Abreu Mendoza interprets Humboldt's analogy of Chimborazo with Michelangelo's dome as the need for a compensatory aesthetic substitute for the insufficient scientific and practical value of the mountain climb. However, rather than defining the Bolivarian and Humboldtian relation with nature, it defines the value of the intertext in the specific case of _Delirio_. We can think of the text as a nerdy response to Humboldt's testimony: if it is useless to climb Chimborazo except for an entertaining narration, and it is more worthwhile to contemplate it from the slopes, I write, overwhelmed by its contemplation, a text in which I narrate my adventure without making the useless excursion. In this sense, it is true that _on Chimborazo_ Humboldt's experience of American nature invariably leads to an aestheticization. But to define the whole Humboldt-Bolivarian American experience exclusively from that writing experience only functions to sustain the messianic reception of the _Delirio_ that Abreu Mendoza well characterizes–a reception that, as we have already exposed, belongs to a posthumous, post and perhaps anti-Bolivarian program of instrumentalization.

On the other hand, the affirmation of a nature that when it is not measurable is excluded from the order of rationality and assimilated to the order of the aesthetic sublime, would place Humboldt and Bolivar still too close to "the old Viconian-Hobbesian idea that we, humans, could have proper knowledge of only civil and political institutions because we made them, while nature remains God's work and ultimately inscrutable to man" (Dipesh Chakrabarty 201). In the case of the former, there would be some echoes of the inscrutable as the limit of the civil in the notion of the plains as a barrier to history, and of the llaneros whose agency belonged to the plains. In the case of Bolivar, in the _Manifesto_ he resorts to providence to give a name to that which politically orders the sunderedness of human race. In both cases, there are other areas of his work that reestablish a radically different relationship with the immeasurable natural of _Views_ and _Manifesto_. But even if we remain within these texts, the mutual contamination of the commensurable and the incommensurable makes it difficult to sustain that vision, which before the _Delirium_ and after the _Manifesto_ Hegel would categorically organize as peoples belonging to history and peoples belonging to geography.

To point out the way in which Bolivar inhabited with reason what in 1814 he attributed to God and nature, a historical inaccuracy in the review of Bolivar presented in the _LAER_ helps us: "After nearly a decade of conflict, he crossed th Andes with a Haitian army and took control of Colombia in 1819" (French and Heffes 76). The apocryphal data produces in a metonymy what Zizek calls a super-rapid historicization: In 1816, after returning to Venezuela with an army of Haitians to decree the abolition of slavery, Bolívar began a series of operations, speeches, pacts and exploits

, which led him to cross the platforms with some of the same men he had called beasts in 1814 – and who, like the Haitians, had been slaves, if not outlaws, before becoming republican soldiers. And this accidental metonymy underscores one of the most relevant points of Humboldt and Bolívar's relationship, both in Chimborazo and in his work as a whole: the imaginary integration of the continent's geography, which Manzoni has already pointed out in

his study of Bolívar's writing.

The journey from the Caribbean to the other side of the Andes and Chimborazo, passing through the Amazon, epically allegorizes Humboldt's overview of American nature that revolutionized the 19th century literati. But it also traces the territories of the liberating campaign that Bolívar traversed. Therefore, the image of an Haitian army crossing the Andes, foregrounds two aspects of the Humboldtian influence in Bolívar, more relevant and definitory than what the aesthetic reading of Delirio may reveal: the advocacy for abolitionismabolicionism, and the struggle for the confederation of what we call today Latin America.

## ​A new dimension of the human

If there are some traces left behind in 1822 by Bolivar with respect to Humboldt's nature, these have to do with what the liberation of the slaves in Venezuela in 1816, and later in all of Gran Colombia in 1820, produces in the concept of humanity. The ecstatic and poetic gaze that Bolivar endorses of Chimborazo in 1822, where he recognizes Humboldt's legacy and proposes its overcoming, thematizes a shared passion, and an escalation of Bolivar towards a territory unreached by the German. This territory is that of integrationist and abolitionist yearning turned into action. When, at the end of the poem, Bolivar says "men" he is inhabiting a community of meaning in which the category of human has been extended to all members of the species.

Certainly, in his private literary exercise, Bolívar contributes to form, from this fictitious dialogue with Humboldt's footsteps, the posthumous nationalist myth enthroned in his name that Fernando Coronil describes: "The narrative of Bolívar's triumph depicts the patrician hero as having redirected the rebel masses' anarchic energies toward the construction of a liberal national order" (178). This messianic horizon is the one that Tito Salas condenses in _Apoteosis del Libertador_ and that Mendoza characterizes as "a virulent and delirious prophet, a patriarchal messiah," who has defined the reading of the poem as a revelation of the messianic aura of the Liberator (292, 303). But this cultural fiction -which as we have already exposed is in every sense post- or anti-Bolivarian- says  little about the way in which the Bolivarian project impacted the concept of nature from the learnings of Humboldtian writing or its more immediate consequences.

The greatest impact of the Bolivarian deed in this sense was to redefine in practical terms the limits that since the 17th century excluded huge masses of humans from the "assumption that the role of the state is to provide security of life and property" and "making greater numbers of people live safer" (Dipesh Chakrabarty 205)

The extension of property and sovereignty rights to populations that in the outset had been categorized as "beasts" and as "matter" ended up defining, strictly speaking, the planet as a slave of the species as a totality.

## Notes

1
Mendoza quotes this version by the Venezuelan historian ÁngelGrisanti: "En un pueblecito cercano al Chimborazo se sirvió un banquete a Bolívar … Los repetidos brindis formaron quizá un diminuto Orinoco … Bolívar era, por su temperamento, el más eufórico de todos. Y en tal estado de ebriedad patriótica le parecería"muy fácil y sin peligro," la ascensión al Gigante de Nieve. Él, que habitualmente caminaba a paso precipitado, debió subir más aceleradamente que de costumbre, como consecuencia de los repetidos brindis del banquete. Esta leve intoxicación, el mal de las alturas, el Atsma, puna o soroche a que era muy sensible, y la precipitación con que escala el volcán, le causan un desvanecimiento, percance frecuente que sufren los "Neófitos," y hasta los mismos alpinistas. Es entonces, cuando Bolívar se tiende a descansar sobre la roca que desde ese instante se llama "Piedra de Bolívar." Es entonces, durante esta momentánea postración, cuando Bolívar concibe su Delirio, su deslumbrante página literaria, al que le dará forma concreta esa noche, en Riobamba"

In "El 'espejo roto' de la Colombia bolivariana (1820-1850)"Lomné examines the issue of the dissolution of the Republic of Colombia, in the face of the symbolic construction of nationalism in the countries that formed it, which instrumentalized through cultural fictions the basis of the Colombian anti-colonial project, stripping it of its integrationist character (cited by Echeverri et al. 25).

To encourage himself, he recalls his own exploits and what the goddess whose mantle he is using did to defeat Belona. Then he is possessed by the god of Colombia, a new deity, outside all known mythology.
